# Mini deep-learning framework

**EPFL | [Deep Learning(EE559)](https://fleuret.org/ee559/) | mini-project 2**

- Team member: Pengkang GUO, Xiaoyu LIN, Zhenyu ZHU

## Description
The objective of this project is to design a mini "deep learning framework" using only pytorch's
tensor operations and the standard math library, hence in particular **without using autograd or the
neural-network modules**.

## Requirements
Pytorch, Numpy

## Run
From the root of the project: `python test.py`
